    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef (preferably 80% lean and 20% fat)</li>
        <li>Hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sliced onions</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Cheese slices (optional)</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill or stovetop pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into portions, approximately Â¼ pound each, and shape them into patties. Make sure the patties are slightly larger than the size of the hamburger buns, as they shrink during cooking.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the patties generously with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Brush a bit of cooking oil onto the grill or pan to prevent sticking, then place the patties on the heated surface.</li>
        <li>Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. If adding cheese, place a slice on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
        <li>While the patties cook, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
        <li>Once the patties are cooked, remove them from the heat and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers by spreading ketchup and mustard on the bottom bun. Layer lettuce, tomato slices, onion slices, pickles, and the cooked patty (with or without cheese) on top.</li>
        <li>Place the top bun over the ingredients, pressing gently to hold everything together.</li>
        <li>Serve the hamburgers while they're still warm and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
