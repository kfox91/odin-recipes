    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sushi rice</li>
        <li>Sushi-grade fish</li>
        <li>Nori Seaweed Sheets</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Rice Vinegar</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pickled Ginger</li>
        <li>Wasabi</li>
        <li>Bamboo Sushi Mat</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the sushi rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Gently fold this mixture into the cooked rice, ensuring the grains are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Prepare your fillings by slicing the fish into thin strips and julienning the vegetables into long, thin pieces.</li>
        <li>Place a sheet of nori seaweed on a bamboo sushi mat (optional) or a clean, flat surface.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking, and grab a handful of sushi rice. Spread it evenly on the nori, leaving about an inch of space at the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange your desired fillings on top of the rice, placing them horizontally across the sheet.</li>
        <li>Using the bamboo mat (or your hands), carefully roll the sushi, applying gentle pressure to create a tight roll. Moisten the top edge of the nori with water to seal the roll.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients until you have made the desired number of rolls.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and arrange the sushi pieces on a serving platter.</li>
        <li>Serve with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi on the side for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
