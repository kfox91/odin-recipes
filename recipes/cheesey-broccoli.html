    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Broccoli florets</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese (grated)</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic powder (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lightly grease a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Steam or blanch the broccoli florets until they are crisp-tender. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk continuously for about a minute to form a smooth paste, known as a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the grated cheddar cheese. Stir until the cheese melts completely and the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Season the cheese sauce with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder (if desired) to taste. Adjust the seasonings according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Arrange the steamed broccoli florets in the greased baking dish.</li>
        <li>Pour the cheese sauce over the broccoli, ensuring it is evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
